## 📘 About CS50x

CS50x is Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science, covering foundational topics including:
- Algorithms
- Abstraction
- Data Structures
- Memory
- Software Engineering
- Web Development

Languages used: C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

---

## 🎯 My Goals
- Build a strong foundation in computer science
- Learn how to think computationally and solve real problems
- Apply these concepts in personal projects and teaching
- Prepare for a future in CS research, education, or tech leadership
